When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    Can be shared much more easily. Can be used remotely.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    We might lose information by pulling it automatically. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    fork is to clone a github repository into your github account. Fork is used when you do not want/can not make changes to the existing 
	repository. Clone is to clone a repository from github into the local machine or from one local place to another. Used to work offline.
	Branch is to create a new logical change while keeping a copy of the other branches. This is used while adding new features.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
