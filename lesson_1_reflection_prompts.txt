How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Easy to check via split windows in npp
	Highlights the differences	

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It lets you see the changes made.
	Lets you comapare versions
	Can help find bugs

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros:
	Allows you to commit only when a logical change has been made.
	Lesser versions to go through.

	Cons:
	YOu have to manually do it.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Some programs span multiple files. So it makes sense to keep track of all changes to each file as they would have changed together.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log shows the history of all changes commited with an ID and a small description of the change.
	`git diff ID1 ID2` shows the differences between the commits with ID1 and ID2. Deletions in Red and Additions in Green.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    We can checkout different logs and compare using git diff to find out the bug. "Move fast, break things"
